## some complaints :p

I think the current path of artificial intelligence can never lead to the ideal strong artificial intelligence which is like in the movie. The academia is drawing a giant pie, publish loads of "garbage paper" every year. 

In china like my school, even need every graduate student to publish a top class English paper, and you are just a graduate student, if you are not lucky encough, you will get no instruction from mentor professor or phd or even senior graduates. Even for a garbage paper, it is very painful.

I think the reason is some of the Chinese professors do not deserve to be a professor, and the academic education orientation is wired, make the students wasting their time to struggle, but do not focus on student ability development.
