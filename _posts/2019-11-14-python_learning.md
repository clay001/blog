## Preface

Python is a very popular language, it is easy to learn and can make you get rid of  many annoying things. It is specifically suitable for data analysis, so it is widely used in research. However, lots of unscrupulous businessmen take advantage of this and offer many courses to teach python, and tell you that if you pay and take the lessons, which can give you a guarantee of high salary. I think is a waste of your money and mess up the supply-demand relationship in the market. Why? First you need to know about it, and then you will find the answer.

## some complaints :p

I think the current path of artificial intelligence can never lead to the ideal strong artificial intelligence which is like in the movie. The academia is drawing a giant pie, publish loads of "garbage paper" every year. 

In china like my school, even need every graduate student to publish a top class English paper, and you are just a graduate student, if you are not lucky encough, you will get no instruction from mentor professor or phd or even senior graduates. Even for a garbage paper, it is very painful.

I think the reason is some of the Chinese professors do not deserve to be a professor, and the academic education orientation is wired, make the students wasting their time to struggle, but do not focus on student ability development.

## tensorflow 2.0

咕果，哈哈这个中国名字真的可爱，它更新啦！

之前我做深度学习的时候用的pytorch，tensorflow了解的不算多，但是最近感觉工业界用TF还是大势，而且信仰之厂的产品说什么也得学一下，刚好它出了2.0的大改版本，就去玩一下吧，感觉和以前的版本还真的有很多不同的，API做了很大的改动，这意味着很多原来的功能如果想要在TF2里实现，用TF1的代码是跑不通的（貌似有做兼容的工作，但都有2了干嘛还抱着1呢，反正我也没包袱哈哈）。（[这里有一份对照表](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0)）

TF2.0的核心功能是Eager execution（动态图机制），
