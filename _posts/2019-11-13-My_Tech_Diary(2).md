## Where should we go?

Nowadays, more and more people want to be programmers, their purpose is always the same: for money. Well it is not wrong, but I just feel that something is wrong. In the past, when people talk about programmer, the first impression coming to the mind is that they are not good at communicating with others, loving staying messy at home, rigid, boring and heavy workload. Yeah, you are right, they are all stereotypes. But look at now, programmers are symbols of high IQ, successful, high salaries etc. The shift is so fast, I think it is the propaganda went awry. 

The media vigorously agitate artificial intelligence, deep learning, news are all about how rich programmers are, depicts the technical bright future for you and thousands of training institutions came up saying that they can make you rich. Bullshit, by the way I always don't like social media, they are the monster who has the power to manipulate the public mind and reverse black and white. It is not good for both society and academia, not everyone is suitable for programmer, and the future is not that "bright". Will the salary always match to your effort? What you sacrificed? Health? Happiness?

Although myself is a half way programmer, but I think there is something more important than money, I feel happy when I am doing what I want to do. I saw lots of people dived into this area but don't know why they dived. They feel unhappy all the time but making the job competition way too severe. 

Well, stop thinking here, just keep going my way :)

## 第一次ak了周赛

这次的周赛比较简单，基本都是不太用脑子的暴力解法就可以搞定，但非常珍贵的是学了一些很好用的用法，首先是eval函数，它可以将字符串转为变量名进行访问，相似的还有local和vars，还没尝试过。

其次是C++和python中class里面的定义和调用。以及运用dfs编写程序的一些思路，先写好主函数框架，定好需要传入的参数，然后再去补dfs的细节。

然后学到了枚举可以用1<<n，然后在for里用n>>i进行按位访问，这时候就用到了很多大佬很喜欢用的按位与&或者一些其他的操作了。

## 双周赛+周赛+kick start的酸爽周末

做题做上瘾，同时还能追追星，舒服，所以我又去啦

## 164周赛

这次真的福利，前三题都很简单，

## 关于算法复杂度的分析
