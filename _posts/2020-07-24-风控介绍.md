## To You

When I think of you, I'm reminded of the beautiful plains of Iowa.The distance between us is breaking my spirit. My time and experiences without you are meaningless to me. Falling in love with you was the easiest thing I have ever done. Nothing matters to me but you.And everyday I am alive, I'm aware of this. I loved you the day I met you, I love you today, and I will love you to rest of my life.
