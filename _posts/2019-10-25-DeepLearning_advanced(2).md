## Recap

The field of deep learning is developing very fast, and there are a lot of exciting technical details which I am really interested in. I have tooken both DL and ML lessons, but since my recent research topic is far from the frontier, I find that I have forgotten a lot of theoretical foundations and operation skill which I learned before. Therefore I think the best way is to keep learning.

The purpose of this blog post is to record some important core foundations while keeping close to the cutting edge, and learn some latest technical breakthroughs.
