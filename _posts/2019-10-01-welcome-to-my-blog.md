## Writing in the front
This is my first attempt to build a blog website by myself, I used to write blogs on other social media community, so it will take some time for me to transfer all the blog articles to here!

I am so excited to create my own space, and the mood is just like moving to a new big house.

Sure I will keep on sharing knowledge and recording some of my thoughts.

Hope you will like it, and we can make progress together!

ps. I'll add comments feature when I have time, so we can communicate with each other.
