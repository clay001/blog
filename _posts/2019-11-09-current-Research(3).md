## goals

This project will provide/develop two numerical methods to make use of RNA velocity 

1. Quasi potential from Freidline-Wentzell theory using ordered line method -- to estimate attractor cell states and compute transition pathways 

2. Fokker Planck equation in reduced space -- to model the dynamics and do virtual gene down- / up-regulation

## Store the after analysis object

into my_velocyto_analysis (main file for the following work)

the T-SNE coordinates in TSNE_replot

trying to embed in diffusion component through Scanpy or Pydiff ---> failed

## OLIM for quasi-potential

the chfiled parameter is select inbuilt examples, but we will have no exact solution.

## Generalizing RNA velocity to transient cell statesthrough dynamical modeling
