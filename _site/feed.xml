        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;git&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know the git has version rollback function, but I didn’t care too much before, because I think I’ve already uploaded my file to github, if I just want the previous version back why not just download the file back from GitHub? And I always think that git pull can do this for me, but I was wrong, if I modified the file and ran with git pull, it doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, it is time to pay for my lazyness, I finally met this stupid situation, I messed it up and all I wanted is to get my...</description>

        <title>Deep Learning SOTA(3)</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The field of deep learning is developing very fast, and there are a lot of exciting technical details which I am really interested in. I have tooken both DL and ML lessons, but since my recent research topic is far from the frontier, I find that I have forgotten a lot of theoretical foundations and operation skill which I learned before. Therefore I think the best way is to keep learning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this blog post is to record some important core foundations while keeping close to the cutting edge, and learn some latest technical breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2...</description>

The distance is determined as $1-r_{ij}$ (r is pearson linear correlation of cell i,j on the first 100 principle compoinents of the top 3000 variable genes). Cluster was performed using Louvain community detection algorithm on the nearest neighbor cell graph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Explore with code:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;if %matplotlib inline turns error, you should put in front of the matplotlib import command, because some default setting things in jupyter...</description>

        <title>C++ learning</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;preface&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;C++ is needed when you want to run fast and well-perfomed codes, and it can directly controll the hardware. In fact, when you write some codes, you need to pass it to the complier, and the complier can give you the machine code for your target platform, machine code is the actual instruction that your devices CPU will actual perform. C++ is widely used in almost everywhere, it can support almost all the platforms. Everyone is using it ! Here I record some of the learning notes, check whether you know them all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;hpp和h的区别&quot;&gt;hpp和h的区别&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;hpp（Header Plus Plus）是将.cpp的实现代码混入.h头文件当中，定义与实现都包含在同一文件，调用的时候只需要include该hpp文件即可&lt;/p&gt;...</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;preface&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While waiting for transfering blog articles from other platform, I think create more is more important. &lt;br /&gt; Currently I devote myself to research, work with a very nice professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://heyrim.github.io&quot;&gt;Heyrim Cho :) &lt;/a&gt;(University of California, Riverside) and hope to have a publication at the end of this year. So I start to write this series of blogs, aim to record and clear up my thoughts, also can be seen as my psychological journel, the article’s birth witness and evidence.&lt;br /&gt; Finally, hope it can provide some inspirations to readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;first-paper-in-rna-velocity&quot;&gt;First paper in RNA velocity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We...</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-in-the-front&quot;&gt;Writing in the front&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt to build a blog website by myself, I used to write blogs on other social media community, so it will take some time for me to transfer all the blog articles to here!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am so excited to create my own space, and the mood is just like moving to a new big house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure I will keep on sharing knowledge and recording some of my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hope you will like it, and we can make progress together!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ps. I’ll add comments feature when I have time, so we can...</description>
