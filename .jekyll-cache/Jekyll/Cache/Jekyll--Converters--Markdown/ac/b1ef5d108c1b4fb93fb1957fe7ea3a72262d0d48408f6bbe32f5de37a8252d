I"Î<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>While waiting for transfering blog articles from other platform, I think create more is more important. <br />
Currently I devote myself to research, and hope to have a publication at the end of this year. So I start to write this series of blogs, aim to record and clear up my thoughts, also can be seen as my psychological journel, the articleâ€™s birth witness and evidence.<br />
Finally, hope it can provide some inspiration to readers.</p>
<h2 id="first-paper-in-rna-velocity">First paper in RNA velocity</h2>
<p>We all know RNA-seq, but this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time. When we want to analyze time-resolved phenomena such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration, we need something more.  <br />
RNA abundance is a powerful indicator of the state of individual cells. This paper use this indicator to define a new feature called RNA velocityâ€”the time derivative of the gene expression state.
This feature can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. <br />
Here I captured some important points and listed together:</p>
<ul>
  <li>RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours.</li>
  <li>This paper validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain.</li>
  <li>We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.</li>
</ul>
