<p>The field of deep learning is developing very fast, and there are a lot of exciting technical details which I am really interested in. I have tooken both DL and ML lessons, but since my recent research topic is far from the frontier, I find that I have forgotten a lot of theoretical foundations and operation skill which I learned before. Therefore I think the best way is to keep learning.</p>

<p>The purpose of this blog post is to record some important core foundations while keeping close to the cutting edge, and learn some latest technical breakthroughs.</p>
